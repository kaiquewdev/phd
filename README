At this time, all code and ideas here are completely experimental and untested.
Don't even pretend you know what you're doing in here unless you're one of the
authors. Please do ALL discussion inside the RFC/ directory and leave the rest
of the filespace clean. More comments and information to come.

IMPORTANT
At the moment, the code relies on the following:
    - PHP 5.2.3 or later (including 5.2.4-dev). NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PHP 6.
    - An available CLI binary.
    - SQLite 3, using the PDO driver.
    - PCRE.
    - DOM and libXML2.
    - register_globals, magic_quotes_*, and safe_mode OFF.
    - The "nowdoc" patch for PHP_5_2, available at:
        <http://phpdoc.gwynne.dyndns.org/nowdocs/PHP_5_2.patch>
      
      I recognize the annoyance and confusion involved here; if nowdocs aren't
      implemented in mainline PHP by 5.3, I'll drop them completely and live
      without. However, PhD currently serves as a real-use case for nowdocs,
      and I'd like to have this be their chance to prove their worth. Until
      that decision is made, I'll make every effort to make their use less of a
      hassle for those who can't compile their own PHP.
