  <title>PhD: The definitive guide to PHP's Docbook Rendering System</title>

  <preface>
    <title>About PhD</title>

    <para>PhD is PHP's very own Docbook 5 rendering system. It is used to
    convert the PHP Manual and PEAR Documentation into different output
    formats like XHTML, PDF, Man pages and CHM.</para>

    <para>The goal of PhD is to become a fast, general Docbook rendering
    system. At the moment of writing, PhD is already very fast: I can create
    the chunked version of PEAR's manual (some 3.000 files) in less than a
    minute on a 2GHz system. It also renders the PHP and PEAR manual
    flawlessly. It does not support every Docbook 5 tag yet, and using it to
    render own docbook files may need some tweaks.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Installation</title>

      <para>PhD is distributed via an own PEAR channel,
      <uri>doc.php.net</uri>. Using it is also the most easy way to get
      it.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Docbook extensions</title>

    <para>PhD has been tailored for PHP and PEAR manual. To make writing
    documentation as easy as possible, some own tags have been added to the
    DTD.</para>

    <para>All extensions live in their own xml namespace
    "<literal>phd:</literal>" which resolves to
    <uri>http://www.php.net/ns/phd</uri>. When using one of the attributes or
    tags described here, remember to set the namespace:</para>

    <programlisting>xmlns:phd="http://www.php.net/ns/phd"</programlisting>

      <title>General extensions</title>

      <section>
        <title>Manual chunking with "phd:chunk" (Attribute)</title>

        <para>PhD automatically chooses which sections, chapters or other tags
        get their own file (chunk) when using a chunked theme. Sometimes the
        result of this automatism is not optimal and you want to fine-tune it.
        The attribute "phd:chunk" is offered as solution by PhD.</para>
